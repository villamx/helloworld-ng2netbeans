# helloworld-ng2netbeans

Personally I tried and was pretty straight forward to step forward with Angular 2 and TypeScript using NetBeans 8.2 IDE.

Please, checkout yourself the main resource I used to create this [HelloWorld](https://jaxenter.com/typescript-angular-2-and-netbeans-ide-an-unbeatable-trio-125443.html).

You know, to build the project and run it:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Here some minor things I needed to deal with:
- node_modules/rxjs/Observable.d.ts error [TS2304](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/63) Cannot find name 'Promise'
